# SE-Assignment-6

 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:

- What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.

  KEY FEATURES

1) **Easy to learn and use: Python has a clean and concise syntax, making it accessible to beginners and experienced programmers alike.**
2) **Cross-platform compatibility: Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.**
3) **Extensive standard library: Python comes with a vast collection of built-in modules and libraries that provide functionality for a wide range of tasks.**
4) **Dynamic typing: Python variables can hold values of different data types without explicit declaration.**
5) **Interpreted language: Python code is executed line by line, making it suitable for rapid prototyping and interactive development**

   USE CASES
6) **Web development: Python frameworks like Django and Flask are popular choices for building web applications.**
7) **Data analysis and machine learning: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn make Python a powerful tool for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.**
8) **Scripting and automation: Python's simplicity and readability make it a great choice for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.**
9) **Scientific computing: Python's libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib provide tools for scientific and numerical computing**
10) **Software Development: Developing desktop applications with Tkinter or PyQt.**
11) **Machine Learning: Using libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn.**

2. **Installing Python:**

- Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

**-> Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.**

**-> Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.**

**-> Open a terminal or command prompt and type python --version to verify the installation. If Python is installed correctly, it will display the version number**

**---> macOS:**

**Use the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation prompts.**

**Alternatively, use Homebrew: brew install python3.**

**---> Linux:**

**Use your package manager, for example: sudo apt-get install python3 for Debian-based systems.**

**---> Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv myenv**

 **Activate the virtual environment:**

 **Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate**

 **macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate**

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:

- Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

-> ``print("Hello, World!")``

4. Data Types and Variables:

- List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

**-> int: Integer values, e.g., 10**

**-> float: Floating-point numbers, e.g., 10.5**

**-> str: String literals, e.g., "Hello"**

**-> bool: Boolean values, True or False**

**-> list: Ordered, mutable collection, e.g., [1, 2, 3]**

**-> tuple: Ordered, immutable collection, e.g., (1, 2, 3)**

**-> dict: Key-value pairs, e.g., {'key': 'value'}**

**-> tuple: Ordered, immutable collection, e.g., (1, 2, 3)**

Script demonstrating the creation and usage of variables with different data types:

# Integer

**age = 27**

**print(age)**

# Float

**pi = 3.14**

**print(pi)**

# String

**name = "John Doe"**

**print(name)**

# List

**fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]**

**print(fruits)**

# Tuple

**coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)**

**print("Coordinates:", coordinates)**

# Dictionary

**person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}**

print(person)

5. Control Structures:

- Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

-> Conditional statements allow the execution of code based on certain conditions.

# if-else statement

**age = 18**

**if age >= 18:**

 **print("You are an adult.")**

**else:**

 **print("You are a baby.")**

# for loop

**fruits = ["apple", "mango", "cherry"]**

**for fruit in fruits:**

 **print(fruit)**

6. Functions in Python:

- What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

-> Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

-> They help organize code, promote code reuse, and improve code readability.

**def add_numbers(a, b):**

 **result = a + b**

 **return result**

**sum = add_numbers(10, 20)**

**print(sum)**

7. Lists and Dictionaries:

- Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

**-> Lists:**

1) **Ordered collection of items**
2) **Items can be of different data types**
3) **Accessed by index**
4) **Mutable (elements can be modified)**

**-> Dictionaries:**

1) **Unordered collection of key-value pairs**
2) **Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples)**
3) **Values can be of any data type and are accessed using keys**
4) **Mutable (keys and values can be added, modified, or removed)**

# List example

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing list elements

**print(numbers[0])**

**print(numbers[-1])**

# Dictionary example

**person = {**

 **"name": "John Doe",**

 **"age": 30,**

 **"city": "New York"**

**}**

**print(person)**

# Accessing dictionary values

**print(person["name"])**

**print(person.get("age"))**

8. Exception Handling:

- What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

**-> Exception Handling: A mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing the program to continue execution or gracefully exit.**

**try:**

 **result = 10 / 0  # Raises ZeroDivisionError**

**except ZeroDivisionError:**

 **print("Error: Division by zero.")**

finally:

    print("This block will always execute.")

9. Modules and Packages:

- Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

  -> Modules in Python are files containing Python definitions and statements. They allow you to organize and reuse code.

  -> Packages are collections of modules organized into hierarchical directories. They provide a way to structure Python's module namespace.

import math

# Accessing module functions

result = math.sqrt(36)

print(result)

# Accessing module constants

**pi = math.pi**

**print(pi)**

10. File I/O:

- How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Reading from a file

**with open("work.txt", "r") as file:**

 **content = file.read()**

 **print(content)**

# Writing to a file

**lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]**

**with open("work.txt", "w") as file:**

 **file.writelines(line + "\n" for line in lines)**

# Submission Guidelines:

- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
